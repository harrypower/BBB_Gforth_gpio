This is the Device tree generator page:
http://kilobaser.com/blog/2014-07-28-beaglebone-black-devicetreeoverlay-generator#dtogenerator

This page allows you to make device tree files and gives the information on how to compile and use device tree files.
The file bspm_P9_42_f-00A0.dts is generated on that page.
Do the following to compile it in /lib/firmware directory:
dtc -O dtb -o /lib/firmware/bspm_P9_42_f-00A0.dtbo -b 0 -@ /lib/firmware/bspm_P9_42_f-00A0.dts

Then install the device tree overlay as follows:
echo bspm_P9_42_f > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots
echo 7 > /sys/class/gpio/export

The files to acess the pin P9_42 is at this location:

/sys/class/gpio/gpio7/
